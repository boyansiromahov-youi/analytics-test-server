# Analytics Test Server
You.i Analytics testing tool

This tool is designed to capture analytics by having the app send it directly to the server. You can then browse all captured analytics and export individual analytics or all analytics. 

# Pointing Your Server To This Tool
In order for this tool to work the analytics server needs to be changed in the app to [IP]:3000/[type], where the type is the type of analytics you are testing (adobe, google, or conviva).
